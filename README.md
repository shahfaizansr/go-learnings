# Go Learnings üêπ

This repository contains my hands-on journey of learning the Go (Golang) programming language. It includes mini-projects and examples such as:

- Basic syntax, structs, slices, maps
- REST APIs using the Gin framework
- SQL database connectivity
- Error handling and logging
- Unit testing using Go's `testing` package

## Goals
- Build backend projects using Go
- Understand clean architecture principles in Go
- Strengthen my skills for real-world backend development
